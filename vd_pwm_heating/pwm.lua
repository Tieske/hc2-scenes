-- PWM based heating control
-- =========================
-- Pulse Width Modulation algorythm. It uses an on/off heating system and varies the time
-- the heating is on, based on an input percentage and system parameters.

-- enable some debug output for testing
-- set to true to enable
local debugmode = false

-- the device id of the heating relay.
-- Closing the relay starts the heating system, opening it stops heating.
local relayId = 141

-- What time is necessary after starting the heating system (by closing the relay) to actually feed heat into the room.
-- (time to open the valve, start the boiler, pump the water into the room, etc.)
-- For electrical heating this is 0 for example, for water/boiler based underfloor heating, this might be a few minutes.
local startupTime = 3  -- in minutes

-- Minimum duration of heating the room. This excludes the startupTime.
-- So a startupTime of 2 minutes, and a minimum heating time of 4 minutes, would lead to minimum cycle time
-- of 6 minutes between opening and closing the relay.
-- NOTE: this will not be honored if an extremely low load is set (eg. 0-5%)
local minHeatingTime = 3  -- in minutes

-- How many heating cycles to use per hour. This should be set based on how quickly the room temperature 
-- responds and the startupTime. 
-- Eg. electrical heating is quick, and has no startupTime, so a higher number of cycles is appropriate
-- Water based underfloor heating has a high startupTime, and is slow responding, so a lower number of cycles 
-- should be set
-- Examples for the Secure SRT321 thermostat manual;
-- For Gas boilers set to 6 cycles per hour.
-- For Oil boilers set to 3 cycles per hour.
-- For Electric heating set to 12 cycles per hour.
-- NOTE: This will not be honored if startupTime and minHeatingTime require a lower number of cycles
-- per hour.
local hourlyCycles = 3  -- in cycles per hour
